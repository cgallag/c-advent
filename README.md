# Caroline's Advent of Code Adventures

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a set of Christmas-themed programming challenges released during December 
2015. 

I created this repository to store my work on the various puzzles. You can get two gold stars for each day.

This is the current state of my advent tree:
